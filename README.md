# Farmer Customer Connection
## About the Project:
The project’s main objective is to design an e-commerce platform where customers can directly purchase products from farmers.

## Description:
The farmer can the add details of the products that he had into the application with the quantity and price he is expecting. He can also add the areas he can give service. The farmer will get the orders from the customer and he can either accept the order or cancel the order. 
	
On the other hand, The customers can add the products that they are interested in into the cart and place an order. The customer is provided with an address option while ordering. If the customer is ok with the registration address he can use it else he can change the address where he needs the delivery to be placed.
